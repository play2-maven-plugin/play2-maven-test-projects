    <h2>The world is going reactive</h2>

    <p>
        Not long ago, response times in the seconds were considered appropriate.  Browser refreshes were the norm in web
        applications.  Systems would go down for hours of maintenance, or even be rebooted nightly, and this was ok
        because people only expected the systems to be up during business hours.  Applications didn't have to scale
        because they didn't have big user bases.  And the complexity requirements put on web applications meant that
        typical requests could easily be handled by a thread per request model.
    </p>

    <p>
        Things are changing though.  People expect web applications to react instantly.  They expect them to be up all
        the time, while the applications are moving into the cloud, where failures are not exceptional, but rather are
        the norm, and so applications need to react to failure.  Load on a web application can peak unpredictably, to
        be many orders of magnitude greater than normal, and so applications need to react to load and scale out.  The
        complexity of business requirements means that in order to respond quickly to requests, things must
        be processed in parallel, reacting to events rather than waiting so as to utilise resources as efficiently as
        possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        This application is an example of how to implement the tenants of the
        <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Reactive Manifesto</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        It uses the latest in client side technologies to implement a reactive user interface.  It uses a MongoDB
        database, using event driven IO via the <a href="http://reactivemongo.org/" target="_blank">ReactiveMongo</a>
        database driver. And it maintains statelessness, ensuring that it can be easily scaled out to many nodes, for
        both fault tolerance and scalability.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Browse the app</h2>

    <p>
        In order to use this app, you'll need to install and run <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a> on the
        default port.  If you don't already have MongoDB installed, you can get it from
        <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once the application has been compiled and the server started, the application can be accessed at:
        <a href="http://localhost:9000" target="_blank">http://localhost:9000</a>.  You can check in
        <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> to see the server status.
    </p>

    <p>
        Open the application by clicking the above link, and try adding some messages.  The application is just a simple
        message board, you can post messages, the messages are paged.
    </p>

    <p>
        Try opening the app in multiple browser tabs, or even different browsers.  Notice that whenever any browser
        tab adds a message, the message instantly appears in every browser tab.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Code Overview - Templates</h2>

    <p>
        The HTML page you're seeing is implemented using Scala templates, so we'll start there.  The main page is
        <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a>.  It starts with a call to
        the main decorator template, <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main.scala.html</a>.
        Inside it is first the modal dialog box for adding messages, then the text for the left hand side of the page,
        then the paging and rendering of messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see on many HTML elements there is a <code>data-bind</code> attribute.  These are
        <a href="http://knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">knockout.js</a> binding attributes that allow binding data and
        behaviour into the HTML page.  You can also see the use of many
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> styles.  Bootstrap allows you to create a very
        good looking site within minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Moving into <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main.scala.html</a>, this is the template
        that wraps all other templates (currently the only other one is the index).  It is where the stylesheets and
        Javascript assets are brought in.  Notice the <code>@routes.Assets.at()</code> and
        <code>@routes.WebJarAssets.at()</code> calls.  These are reverse routes, they allow you to keep your routing
        path configuration separate from the templates that consume the routing information.  Also notice that we are
        using <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> to handle JavaScript modularisation.
    </p>

    <p>
        For more information on Scala templates, see
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaTemplates" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Code Overview - CoffeeScript</h2>

    <p>
        The client side code for this application is implemented using
        <a href="http://coffeescript.org/" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>.  The main file for this code is
        <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut">app.coffee</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first line of the file
        is the <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> declaration, if you've used RequireJS
        before, you may notice something different - some of the modules are prepended with <code>webjars!</code>.
        This tells RequireJS to use <a href="http://www.webjars.org/" target="_blank">WebJars</a> to locate these
        modules.  Rather than being managed by downloading them onto the filesystem, WebJars modules are managed by the
        build system, you can see in the applications
        <a href="#code/project/Build.scala" class="shortcut">Build.scala</a> file dependencies declared on various
        different WebJars.  This has the advantage of upgrading being a simple configuration item, and also allows
        WebJars, in combination with RequireJS, to automatically pull in transitive dependencies.
    </p>

    <p>
        You'll also notice the <code>routes.js</code> module, this is the
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaJavascriptRouting" target="_blank">Play
        JavaScript reverse router</a>.  Like the reverse router that we saw earlier, the JavaScript reverse router
        allows you to decouple your routing path configuration from your JavaScript code.  The JavaScript reverse router
        is able to build dynamic URLs based on parameters that you pass in, and also knows the correct HTTP method for a given route.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rest of the file is a <a href="http://knockoutjs.com" target="_blank">knockout.js</a> model, declaring
        a number of observable properties that are bound to in the templates we saw earlier, and declaring a number
        of behavioural methods that update the view and make ajax calls, using the JavaScript reverse router.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Code Overview - LESS</h2>

    <p>
        Most of the styles used by this application come from
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, and as we saw before, it was brought in
        via WebJars in <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html" class="shortcut">main.scala.html</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We do need to define a very small amount of our own styling though, to do this we're using
        <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a>, an extension to CSS that grants extra functionality so
        that you can write very concise, simple and easy to manage stylesheets.  Play automatically compiles LESS
        stylesheets to CSS for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our LESS style sheet can be found in
        <a href="#code/app/assets/stylesheets/main.less" class="shortcut">main.less</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Code Overview - Routing and Actions</h2>

    <p>
        When Play receives a web request, it needs to know how to route that request to some code to handle the request.
        Play uses the <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a> file to declare this configuration,
        and then it compiles this into a statically typed router, and also compiles it into the reverse router and
        JavaScript router as we've already seen.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each route declares a request method, a path, which may have some dynamic parts, and then an action to handle
        it.  The action is a method on a controller, and the parameters to those methods are the dynamic parts of the
        path, as well as any query string parameters that you wish to pass.  Since the routes file is compiled to Scala,
        an error, including type errors with parameters, will be found at compile time, you don't need to wait till
        runtime.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first route in the routes file points to the <code>index</code> method on the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MainController.scala" class="shortcut">MainController</a>.  This method simply
        renders the <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a> template that we
        saw earlier.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the main controller you can also see the <code>router</code> method, this is what generates the JavaScript
        router.  Each route that we want exposed in the JavaScript router is passed here.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can read more about HTTP routing and actions in Play
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaRouting" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Messages</h2>

    <p>
        This is an app that saves and retrieves messages, so we need to have some way to model these messages.  This is
        done in the <a href="#code/app/models/Message.scala" class="shortcut">Message</a> class.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see that a message as an id, the name given to it is <code>_id</code> because this is what MongoDB
        requires.  The type of the id is a <code>BSONObjectId</code>, again, this is a MongoDB data type that allows
        generation of unique ids.  And a message also has a message string.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the <code>Message</code> companion object, we have an implicit JSON <code>Format</code> object.  This will
        be used whenever a message is passed to a method that requires a <code>Format</code> type class.  ReactiveMongo
        requires this when saving or loading objects from the database, and the Play JSON library requires this when
        serialising or deserialising objects to and from JSON.
    </p>

    <p>
        The format object itself is created using the <code>Json.format</code> macro.  This allows 100% type safe at
        compile time data binding of case classes to and from JSON, if <code>Message</code> was to have a field of a
        type that Play did not know how to handle, a compilation error would be thrown, you would not have to wait
        until runtime to find that error.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can read more information about Play's JSON handling
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaJson" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Talking to MongoDB</h2>

    <p>
        We are using <a href="http://reactivemongo.org/" target="_blank">ReactiveMongo</a> to interface to MongoDB.
        ReactiveMongo is a fully asynchronous database driver, no calls on it ever block a thread.
    </p>

    <p>
        The code to save and load messages can be found in
        <a href="#code/app/services/MessageDao.scala" class="shortcut">MessageDao</a>.  The <code>collection</code>
        method gets a reference to a MongoDB collection, if you haven't used MongoDB before, a collection is roughly
        equivalent to a table in a relational database.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice that every method in the DAO returns <code>Future</code>.  A future is a value that may not yet be
        available, but will be available sometime in the future.  You cannot interact with it directly, there is no way
        to get the value out of it now, in fact doing so would be very bad because it would require blocking if the
        value wasn't yet available.  Rather, you can interact by passing callbacks to methods such as <code>map</code>
        and <code>flatMap</code>.  <code>map</code> allows you to transform the value to another value, possibly of
        another type, while <code>flatMap</code> allows you to perform another asynchronous operation.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can see in the <code>save</code> method, after calling <code>collection.save()</code>, we get back a future
        of the status of the save call.  But we want to return a <code>Future[Message]</code>, so we <code>map</code>
        the status future to a message, if the operation completed successfully.  Since this code is non blocking, the
        <code>save</code> call will return almost immediately, before the database action has even started.  But the
        returned <code>Future[Message]</code> allows the caller of the <code>save</code> method to perform its own
        operations once the future is redeemed.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can read more about asynchronous programming in Play
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAsync" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Asynchronous actions</h2>

    <p>
        As we saw before, all actions that we do on MongoDB are asynchronous, they return futures.  Navigate to the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MessageController.scala" class="shortcut">MessageController</a> to see how we
        use these asynchronous calls on <code>MessageDao</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a simple example, take a look at the <code>saveMessage</code> method.  You can see that after calling
        <code>MessageDao.save</code>, we map its result to a 201 Created response.  At this point we have a 
        <code>Future[Result]</code>, we then wrap that in the <code>Async</code> call to return it to Play, and Play
        will handle that asynchronously, without blocking.
    </p>

    <p>
        A more complex example is the <code>getMessages</code> method, which makes multiple calls on the
        <code>MessageDao</code>, one to get the count of all messages, another to get a page of messages.  To make
        multiple asynchronous calls, we're using for comprehensions:
    </p>

    <pre><code>for {
  count <- MessageDao.count
  messages <- MessageDao.findAll(page, perPage)
} yield { ... }</code></pre>

    <p>
        Each line in the for block is equivalent to a call to <code>flatMap</code> on the result of the line before.
        This means each line is a callback that gets executed asynchronously - it looks like ordinary sequential code,
        but actually is non blocking and asynchronous.  The <code>yield</code> block is equivalent to a
        <code>map</code> call on the eventual result.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Events</h2>

    <p>
        Up to now we've seen how the app implements the loading and the saving of messages, from the frontend through
        to the backend.  There's one major feature left to show, and that's how the browser reacts to new messages
        being published.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notifying browsers about messages requires publishing events.  A naive approach to event publishing would be
        to have an in memory register of event listeners.  This works fine if you have one node, but in a scalable,
        fault tolerant and reactive world, this will not be the case.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many technologies that we could use to publish events that all nodes can see, including
        <a href="http://akka.io" target="_blank">Akka</a> and
        <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a>.  Since we're already using MongoDB, we're going
        to take a very simple option, MongoDB
        <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-tailable-cursor/" target="_blank">tailable cursors</a>
        on top of capped collections.
    </p>

    <p>
        A MongoDB capped collection is a collection with a maximum size, when that size is reached, the oldest
        documents written to the database a overwritten with any new documents that are inserted.  Tailable cursors
        allow you to reactively receive documents from the collection as they are inserted into the collection.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>The EventDao</h2>

    <p>
        The <a href="#code/app/services/EventDao.scala" class="shortcut">EventDao</a> allows publishing of events and
        also produces a stream of events to subscribe to.
    </p>

    <p>
        We load the collection in a bit of a different way to in the <code>MessageDao</code>, we need to make sure that
        the collection is configured to be a capped collection, and this requires some asynchronous calls to the
        database that need to be made before the collection will be useable.  For this reason, the collection is a
        future, and so you can see each time we use it we use a for comprehension to get the actual collection.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, we don't want to do the check every time we use the collection, only when Play starts up.  So
        we've implemented a Play plugin, this allows us to hook into the Play lifecycle.  The plugin is registered in
        <a href="#code/conf/play.plugins" class="shortcut">play.plugins</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The stream method creates an enumerator based on a tailable cursor of the collection.  An enumerator is an
        asynchronous stream producer, enumerators get used in combination with iteratees, which are asynchronous stream
        consumers.  This enumerator is also managed by the plugin, we ensure that there is only one tailable cursor
        opened for the whole app, and then we wrap this enumerator in a broadcast enumerator to allow many clients to
        consume from it.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can read more about iteratees and enumerators
        <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Iteratees" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Server-Sent Events</h2>

    <p>
        Our event stream is streamed to the browser using
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-eventsource-20091029/" target="_blank">Server-Sent Events</a>.  The route
        for the stream can be found in the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MainController.scala" class="shortcut">MainController</a>.  Our stream is fed
        into the event source enumeratee - an enumeratee is a transformer of asynchronous streams.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you look in the <a href="#code/app/models/Event.scala" class="shortcut">Event</a> model object, you can see
        that we've defined a comet message extractor for getting the data for the event, as well as an id extractor
        and a name extractor.  The name extract in particular is important, it allows us to subscribe to events by name
        on the client side.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the client side, at the bottom of
        <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut">app.coffee</a>, you can see where we are
        creating the <code>EventSource</code> stream (using the JavaScript reverse router to get the URL), and then
        subscribing to message events.  For each message event, we add the message (the data of the event) to the
        messages on the screen, if we are on the first page.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>
        Configuration for the application is defined in
        <a href="#code/conf/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>.  This is for example where the
        <code>mongodb.url</code> configuration is defined.
    </p>

    <p>
        Configuration for the build system is defined in
        <a href="#code/project/Build.scala" class="shortcut">Build.scala</a>.  This is an
        <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/" target="_blank">sbt</a> build file.  Here all the dependencies of the
        application are declared, along with any build configuration.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Testing</h2>

    <p>
        No application is complete without comprehensive tests.  We are using
        <a href="http://etorreborre.github.io/specs2/" target="_blank">specs2</a> to test the app.  You can run the
        tests by going to the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab, and clicking start.  By default,
        activator will run the tests automatically for you each time you change file.
    </p>

    <p>
        We've started by declaring some helpers in <a href="#code/test/MongoDBTestUtils.scala" class="shortcut">MongoDBTestUtils</a>,
        the primary thing being the <code>withMongoDB</code> method, which sets up and tears down both Play and MongoDB
        before and after the code block passed to it.  It uses the Play test framework to help it, including the
        <code>running</code> method, and creates a <code>FakeApplication</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Navigate to <a href="#code/test/MessageControllerSpec.scala" class="shortcut">MessageControllerSpec</a> to see
        an example set of specs.  These invoke the methods on the message controller to test them.  They also use a few
        methods provided by the Play test framework, such as <code>header</code> and <code>contentAsString</code>,
        which get headers and the body content out of possibly asynchronously produced results.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding an author field</h2>

    <p>
        Now that we've got an overview of the whole codebase and how it works, let's start to add new functionality.
        We want to add an author field to the messages, so we know who wrote them.  Let's start with adding the author
        field to the add message popup. Open
        <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a> and add a new field below the
        exsting <code>form-group</code> <code>div</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
    &lt;label for="messageAuthorField"&gt;Author&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" class="form-control" id="messageAuthorField" placeholder="Enter author"
        data-bind="value: messageAuthorField"/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        You can see that we've bound the input element to the <code>messageAuthorField</code> property in the model.  Save the changes and now 
        let's add that to <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut">app.coffee</a>,
        just below the declaration for <code>messageField</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>@messageAuthorField = ko.observable()</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save the file.  Now if you refresh the app and click the <strong>Add message</strong>, you should see the new field, but it doesn't do anything yet.  Let's modify the
        <code>saveMessage</code> method so that it adds the author field to the submitted JSON and then clear the messageAuthorField:
    </p>

    <pre><code>@ajax(routes.controllers.MessageController.saveMessage(), {
  data: JSON.stringify({
    message: @messageField()
    author: @messageAuthorField()
  })
  contentType: "application/json"
}).done(() ->
  $("#addMessageModal").modal("hide")
  self.messageField(null)
  self.messageAuthorField(null)
)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Make sure the indentation is correct and then save the file.  Now to handle this newly submitted field on the server side, open the
        <a href="#code/app/models/Message.scala" class="shortcut">Message</a> model, and add the authors field to
        it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>case class Message(_id: BSONObjectID, message: String, author: String)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save your changes.  Now update the <code>MessageForm</code> in
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MessageController.scala" class="shortcut">MessageController</a> to also accept
        this field, and pass it to the <code>Message</code> object when created:
    </p>

    <pre><code>case class MessageForm(message: String, author: String) {
  def toMessage: Message = Message(BSONObjectID.generate, message, author)
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save your changes.  Before testing this, you may want to prep the database, since any existing data in there won't have the new
        field.  Open a MongoDB command line shell and drop the messages collection:
    </p>

    <pre><code>$ mongo messages
MongoDB shell version: 2.4.6
connecting to: messages
&gt; db.messages.drop()
true</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now we should be able to save authors, the only thing left to do is to render them.  Back in
        <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a>, update the last <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> at the bottom of the file
        to render the author field:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;ul class="list-unstyled messages" data-bind="foreach: messages"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;div class="messageAuthor" data-bind="text: $data.author"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="message" data-bind="text: $data.message"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save the file.  Refresh the app and add a new message.  Now we can see the authors, but they don't look pretty.  Add some styling to
        <a href="#code/app/assets/stylesheets/main.less" class="shortcut">main.less</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>.messageAuthor {
  font-style: italic;
  color: gray;
  float: right;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save the file and refresh the app to see the styled author.  And now you've finished adding your first feature to the app.  The tests are broken though, let's fix them,
        and add a new test.  Modify the <code>createMessage</code> method in the
        <a href="#code/test/MessageControllerSpec.scala" class="shortcut">MessageControllerSpec</a> to also handle the author:
    </p>

    <pre><code>def createMessage(msg: String, author: String = "None") = {
  Await.result(MessageDao.save(Message(BSONObjectID.generate, msg, author)), Duration.Inf)
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        And now modify the "save a message" spec to test saving authors:
    </p>

    <pre><code>"save a message" in withMongoDb { implicit app =&gt;
  status(MessageController.saveMessage(FakeRequest().withBody(
    Json.obj("message" -&gt; "Foo", "author" -&gt; "Bar")
  ))) must_== CREATED
  val messages = Await.result(MessageDao.findAll(0, 10), Duration.Inf)
  messages must haveSize(1)
  messages.head.message must_== "Foo"
  messages.head.author must_== "Bar"
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save the file.  Finally fix the <a href="#code/test/EventsSpec.scala" class="shortcut">EventsSpec</a> to populate the author field:
    </p>

    <pre><code>val message = Message(BSONObjectID.generate, "Foo", "None")</code></pre>

    <p>
        Save the file and now the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">tests</a> should all pass.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Implementing likes</h2>

    <p>
        Now we want to allow people to like messages.  We'll start off with implementing the backend.  You may want to
        first drop the messages collection again, since we'll be modifying it.  Add a likes integer to the
        <a href="#code/app/models/Message.scala" class="shortcut">Message</a> model:
    </p>

    <pre><code>case class Message(_id: BSONObjectID, message: String, author: String, likes: Int)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Before going on, fix the code that creates <code>Message</code> objects in
        <a href="#code/test/MessageControllerSpec.scala" class="shortcut">MessageControllerSpec</a> and
        <a href="#code/test/EventsSpec.scala" class="shortcut">EventsSpec</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we want to add a <code>like</code> method to the
        <a href="#code/app/services/MessageDao.scala" class="shortcut">MessageDao</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>def like(id: String): Future[Boolean] = {
  collection.update(
    Json.obj("_id" -&gt; BSONObjectID(id)),
    Json.obj("$inc" -&gt; Json.obj("likes" -> 1))
  ).map {
    case ok if ok.ok =&gt;
      ok.n == 1
    case error =&gt; throw new RuntimeException(error.message)
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        You can see here that we're using a MongoDB atomic increment operation to update the likes property.  As with
        <code>save</code>, <code>update</code> returns a future, which we are mapping to be a <code>Boolean</code>,
        <code>true</code> if the message existed (<code>ok.n</code> returns the number of documents updated, so if it's
        1, then the document must have existed), otherwise <code>false</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now let's go to the
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MessageController.scala" class="shortcut">MessageController</a>, and the first
        thing we want to do is pass 0 into the <code>Message</code> object created in <code>MessageForm.toMessage</code>,
        since a new message will start with 0 likes.  Then we want to add a <code>likeMessage</code> action:
    </p>

    <pre><code>def likeMessage(id: String) = Action {
  Async {
    MessageDao.like(id).map {
      case true =&gt; NoContent
      case false =&gt; NotFound
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        We're using our newly implemented <code>MessageDao.like</code> method, which returns a
        <code>Future[Boolean]</code>, and we're mapping that to 201 No Content if successful, or 404 Not Found if not
        found.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we need to define a route for our new action.  In <a href="#code/conf/routes" class="shortcut">routes</a>,
        somewhere above the last route (because it's a catch all route):
    </p>

    <pre><code>POST        /message/:id/like      controllers.MessageController.likeMessage(id)</code></pre>

    <p>
        And let's expose this route in our JavaScript router generated in
        <a href="#code/app/controllers/MainController.scala" class="shortcut">MainController</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>Routes.javascriptRouter("routes")(
  routes.javascript.MainController.events,
  routes.javascript.MessageController.likeMessage,
  routes.javascript.MessageController.getMessages,
  routes.javascript.MessageController.saveMessage
)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Finally, before we're done in the backend, we'll add a test in
        <a href="#code/test/MessageControllerSpec.scala" class="shortcut">MessageControllerSpec</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>"allow liking messages" in withMongoDb { implicit app =&gt;
  val message = createMessage("Foo")
  status(MessageController.likeMessage(message._id.stringify)(FakeRequest())) must_== NO_CONTENT
  Await.result(MessageDao.findAll(0, 10), Duration.Inf).head.likes must_== 1
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Run the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">tests</a> to make sure they pass.
    </p>

</div>
<div>

    <h2>Likes on the frontend</h2>

    <p>
        Let's now implement support for likes on the front end.  Let's start of with rendering them in messages list in
        <a href="#code/app/views/index.scala.html" class="shortcut">index.scala.html</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>&lt;ul class="list-unstyled messages" data-bind="foreach: messages"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;div class="likes"&gt;
            &lt;span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up icon"
                data-bind="click: $root.likeMessage"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span data-bind="text: $data.likes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div>
        &lt;div class="messageAuthor" data-bind="text: $data.author"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="message" data-bind="text: $data.message"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        We're using glyphicons from Bootstrap to render a thumbs up button.  A little styling of our own
        <a href="#code/app/assets/stylesheets/main.less" class="shortcut">main.less</a> wouldn't go astray:
    </p>

    <pre><code>.likes {
  float: left;
  margin-right: 10px;
  .icon {
    cursor: pointer;
  }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now you can see that we bound clicking on the thumbs up icon to a <code>likeMessage</code> callback, let's
        implement that in <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut">app.coffee</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>@likeMessage = (message) -&gt;
  self.ajax(routes.controllers.MessageController.likeMessage(message._id.$oid))</code></pre>

    <p>
        Note once again that we are using the JavaScript reverse router here.  Now refresh your browser, and try liking
        a message.  The likes won't appear immediately yet, but after a browser refresh, you should see them.  Don't
        forget to drop your messages collection if you didn't already.
    </p>
</div>

<div>

    <h2>Reactive likes</h2>

    <p>
        The final thing we want to implement is reactive likes - when a user likes a message, every browser that is
        viewing the page should be updated with the new likes total for that message.  On the backend, we'll utilise
        our existing events mechanism to publish a like event when a message is liked.  Update the <code>like</code> method's success handler in the 
        <a href="#code/app/services/MessageDao.scala" class="shortcut">MessageDao</a> file:
    </p>

    <pre><code>case ok if ok.ok =&gt;
  EventDao.publish("like", id)
  ok.n == 1</code></pre>

    <p>
        Let's extend the existing spec for events in <a href="#code/test/EventsSpec.scala" class="shortcut">EventsSpec</a> by adding the following to the "publish a new event when a message is saved" test:
    </p>

    <pre><code>val likeEvent = EventDao.stream |&gt;&gt;&gt; Iteratee.head
MessageDao.like(message._id.stringify)
Await.result(likeEvent, Duration.Inf) must beSome.like {
  case event =&gt;
    event.name must_== "like"
    Json.fromJson[String](event.data).asOpt must beSome(message._id.stringify)
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        In the front end, we want to start by making the likes property on each message observable.  We'll write a small
        utility function to do this, and add it to the <code>MessagesModel</code> class in
        <a href="#code/app/assets/javascripts/app.coffee" class="shortcut">app.coffee</a>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>bindMessage: (message) -&gt;
  message.likes = ko.observable(message.likes)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now when we load messages in the <code>loadMessages</code> function, we want to apply this function to each
        message:
    </p>

    <pre><code>loadMessages: (data, status, xhr) -&gt;
  data.forEach(@bindMessage)
  @messages(data)</code></pre>

    <p>
        And we want to do the same for messages we've received via <code>EventSource</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>message = JSON.parse(e.data)
model.bindMessage(message)
model.messages.unshift(message)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now we can write a handler for like events sent to us by the server.  Each time we recieve a like event, we want
        to iterate through the messages that we have, and if the like event is for that message, we'll increment its
        likes:
    </p>

    <pre><code>events.addEventListener("like", (e) -&gt;
  id = JSON.parse(e.data)
  ko.utils.arrayForEach(model.messages(), (message) -&gt;
    if (message._id.$oid == id)
      message.likes(message.likes() + 1)
  )
)</code></pre>

    <p>
        Now check in your browser to see if it works.  Congratulations, you've created a reactive app using Play,
        MongoDB and knockout.js!
